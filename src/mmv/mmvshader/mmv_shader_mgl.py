# # # # # # Description

    This file is intended to interface with moderngl Python package and provide
some bindings, utilities, a basic preprocessor, shortcuts for mapping images, videos,
pipelines, uniform values, deals with creating textures, window, contexts, rendering,
outputting, giving you a set of utilities for making sound interactive shaders.

    This also automatically includes some MMV specification at the start of the file
so some variable names are reserved or already defined, see below the list.

# # # # # # Usage

Within MMV the expected way is this:

| import mmv
| interface = mmv.MMVPackageInterface()
| mgl = interface.get_mgl_interface(master_shader = True)

This is the same as importing MMVShaderMGL directly from this file.
Also note that (master_shader = True) is expected to be given because that's the guy
who deals with the window and outputting to the screen's resolution, etc.

After that it is expected to be run:

| mgl.target_render_settings(
|     width = WIDTH,
|     height = HEIGHT,
|     ssaa = SUPERSAMPLING,
|     fps = FRAMERATE,
| )

So we have information on how to render.

Width and height will only be fixed size if rendering headless mode or strict mode.
SSAA renders at a higher internal resolution and outputs to screen / renders to file
at the target. Real time window mode width's and height's will be overridden when the
window is resized if strict mode is False otherwise kept the same. More in a few.

You probably want to specify some include directories for the preprocessor to find

| mgl.include_dir(GLSL_INCLUDE_FOLDER)

Where GLSL_INCLUDE_FOLDER is a path on the system, preferably use absolute pathing.

Now we set the "mode" to render, this differs from "quality" which target_render_settings
kind of deals with.

| mgl.mode(
|     window_class = "headless",
|     strict = True,
|     vsync = False,
|     msaa = MSAA,
| )

- window_class: can be "glfw", "pyglet", "headless", etc, see moderngl_window docs. Preferred is GLFW
- strict: Strict mode means to not by any means change the target width and height, render
    at fixed resolution. Forced in headless mode just in case.
- vsync: Wait for buffer swap of the window
    NOTE: IMPORTANT: this heavily degrades MMV multithreaded code performance for some reason
        please write your own vsync if displaying real time. This is implemented on run_shaders.py
    For render mode, vsync = False is preferred so we harvest all we can.
- msaa: Number of multi sampling anti aliasing to use. Shouldn't take much impact on
    performance since MMV doesn't yet works with many geometry

After that you're supposed to loader some master shader from path that renders the final
images only.

| mgl.load_shader_from_path(
|     fragment_shader_path,
|     vertex_shader_path = MMV_MGL_DEFAULT_VERTEX_SHADER, 
| )

# # # # # # Preprocessor

This is the heart of why this file is so big. The general syntax is:
- //#mmv {dictionary}

The easiest and simplest one is:
    - //#mmv {"type": "name", "value": NAME_OF_THIS_SHADER}

The next one is:
    - //#mmv {"type": "include", "value": "coordinates_normalization"}
    - //#mmv {"type": "include", "value": "/path/to/glsl.glsl"}

    Name is the name (without the .glsl) of some file in the included directories.
    For example, if your directory have like:
    
    | include
    | | file1.glsl
    | | file2.glsl

    And you set value to "file1" it'll include the contents of the [file1.glsl]
    based on a mode.

    Mode can be one of the two:

    - multiple: Allow re-including, examples are:
        - [math_constants.glsl]
        - [coordinates_normalization.glsl]

    - once: Only ever include once this file in THIS loaded GLSL. Best example is
        including [mmv_specification.glsl] on the beginning of the file.

    - //#mmv {"type": "include", "value": "coordinates_normalization", "mode": "multiple"}
    - //#mmv {"type": "include", "value": "coordinates_normalization", "mode": "once"}

    It defaults to "multiple".

    This is for avoiding redefining values and functions, for that I advise also not
    to shadow variables, and use stuff like [math_constants.glsl] on the beginning of
    functions where you'll immediately use them. Not recommended using multiple if 
    you're defining functionality or some common variables names

The main (and most complex) mapping is this one:
    - //#mmv {
        "type": "map", "name": name of variables,
        "loader": [image, video, shader, dynshader, pipeline_texture],
        "value": path,
        "width": int, "height": int, (not for dynshader)
        "depth": int, (pipeline_texture only)
    }

    We load some loader with the value interpreted accordingly.
    Width, height and depth not always will be used.

    For all loaders it'll add these variables on the code:
        - sampler2D with name [name], the texture to read from
        - vec2 with name [name]_resolution storing the width and height
        - int with name [name]_width storing the width
        - int with name [name]_height storing the height

    Here's the info on each loader:

    - loader=image:
        This loads some raw contents of a image on the system given by its path
        stored on the [value]. Will get the read image's resolution

    - loader=video: (see *1. below)
        This gets one cv2.VideoCapture of a video on the system given by its path
        stored on the [value]

    - loader=shader: (see *1. below)
        This recursively generates other MMVShaderMGL classes and loads the shader
        on the system given by its path stored on the [value].
        
        This works by creating one FBO and Texture attached to one another so whatever
        we render to the FBO can be accessed on that texture in this OpenGL context
        and, since we share the context, we can use the contents of other shaders.
        
        The pipeline of information is also recursively sent from the master shader,
        the one which is called for the final render, recursively.

        Every other #pragma map on child shaders also works, mapping a video on shader1
        to the screen, applying blur on some other shader1 which have some map like: 
        #pragma map layer1=shader;shader1_path
        then pass this intermediate shader2 which modifies shader1 to some other shader3
        which deals with alpha compositing or something.

    - loader=dynshader:
        I called this "dynamic shader", it DOES NOT REQUIRE WIDTH AND HEIGHT and its 
        textures and target renderers will be dropped and recreated to always match
        the window's or internal width and height resolution.

    - loader=pipeline_texture:
        This creates a empty texture with a certain width, height and depth you can
        write to give by its name. We have this special function:
        
        - mgl.write_texture_pipeline(texture_name = "fft", data = FFT_DATA)
        
        Which finds this texture by name and write some data to it.
        It is good to use this method for communicating big arrays of data between
        Python and the OpenGL stuff.

    (*1.) You are required to pass a width and height for the shape you want the image
        it is not automatically got because we might want to stretch to some specific
        proportion. Does not require depth argument, all are treated as RGBA (vec4)

For getting images out of the window we have two functions:

| mgl.read_into_subprocess_stdin(target)
| mgl.read()

The first one accepts a Python's subprocess.Popen stdin with subprocess.PIPE as a target
and directly writes the value to the stdin (of FFmpeg generally speaking).

The second one gets you the raw data of the window buffer (headless or not).

They should output rgb24 values (RGB, 1 byte = 8 bits each) at the current target width
and height, so please use headless for rendering and be sure to match the width, height,
set FFmpeg's pixel format to rgb24 accepting from a pipe (-i -)

For the MMV specification, what they do, default variables and pipelines keep reading
this file.
