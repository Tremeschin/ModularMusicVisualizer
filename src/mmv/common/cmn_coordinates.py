Polar coordinates are another way of expressing points on a 2d grid.
Instead of saying point coordinate (x, y) we say as in (r, theta) 
whereas r is the distance from the polar ( the origin, center (0, 0) )
and theta the angle (in radians) to what direction you distance yourself
from the origin point.

For example, if r=3 and theta=pi, you end up in the point (-3, 0) because
you distanced yourself 3 units at the pi angle, 180 degrees.

Because of this we can make a rectangular triangle with sides X and Y,
hypotenuse size of r and angle theta, we can express the points as:

y = r.sin(theta)
x = r.cos(theta)
x² + y² = r²

if we divide y/x we have tan(theta) so

y/x = r.sin(theta) / r.cos(theta)
y/x = sin(theta) / cos(theta)
y/x = tan(theta)

I use this because it's easier to generate the visualization bars
with polar coordinates as you just have to set a angle according to the
frequency position on the ditionary and the size of the point is just the r
which is controlled by the FFT magnitude at that point
