First of all I won't get mad at you if you don't follow this sorta guideline, I do prefer it though.

Try to avoid sending photos of the screen taken with an phone, and also either blur or hide any form of personal info of the files you upload here for your safety.

Also try to put as many keywords of the problem or feature suggestion on the title, no need to articulate but just explain it concise. You can develop your thought on the body.

# Should you really create an Issue?

Perhaps join MMV's [Telegram group](https://t.me/modular_music_visualizer), I'd say this is preferred because it's much quicker to ask stuff and give support!!

Creating issues in my opinion is more for planning ahead or notable issues in specific scenarios. In doubt, if you can, asking on the group we can decide together how to continue.

## Feature suggestion

Feel free to give any ideas on features or improvements you want but I've a big note for you:

_Don't take this personally or as an aggression but stuff needs work to be done, hence why quite a few people in their first contact with some Open Source project can get a bit intimidated by the "no" word._

Any form of help is not only valid but encouraged, however some scenarios one can think they're doable and they really aren't or diverges a bit from the creators point of view on the future of the project.

## Bugs, stuff broken.

Try to keep the explanation divided into many small segments, it's easier to digest the information. Also try to give as much information you can on what broke, try to filter non related things on the main issue as well.

Please, if you think your issue is platform related (like a dead link for downloading Windows externals) explicitly say the platform you're running the MMV code.

Not a hard requirement but at least show some effort you tried tinkering or fixing the issue by yourself, though I won't feel annoyed if you ask basic stuff such as "how to run Python" on the group.
