First of all I won't get mad at you if you don't follow this sorta guideline, I do prefer it though.

Try to avoid sending photos of the screen taken with an phone, and also either blur or hide any form of personal info of the files you upload here.

Also try to put as many keywords of the problem or feature suggestion on the title, no need to articulate but just explain it concise. You can develop your thought on the body.

# Should you create an Issue or Discussion?

Consider creating a new discussion instead of an full issue if your problem or feature request is "lightweight" enough.

I don't have a full criteria for this and it doesn't really matter in the end, but for something like a quick support ticket or question how to do X it might unclutter the issues tab on the future and keep it focused.

As a general rule of thumb and some examples I consider:

- Should open an Issue: [Completely wrong / heavily broken Piano Roll], [Soft locked because Python dependency X],  [Cannot use GLFW (headless | on platform X)], [Skia segfaults], [Audio file not being read properly]

- Should open a discussion: [How to render the video in a higher quality?], [Want to add new color preset for music bars], [How does X work internally?], [Why can't I do X]

## Feature suggestion

Feel free to give any ideas on features or improvements you want but I've a big note for you:

_Don't take this personally or as an aggression but stuff needs work to be done, hence why quite a few people in their first contact with some Open Source project can get a bit intimidated by the "no" word._

Don't get this wrong, any form of help is not only valid but encouraged, however some scenarios one can think they're doable and they really aren't or diverges a bit from the creators point of view on the future of the project.

This is where forking a project comes in, if you really want a feature go there and code it, I've done this a few times in the past on others projects. I'm aware coding is not for everyone but that's the single thing that keeps projects such as MMV going give or take it.

## Bugs, stuff broken.

Try to keep the explanation divided into many small segments, it's easier to digest the information.

Please, if you think your issue is platform related (like a dead link for downloading Windows externals) explicitly say the platform you're running the MMV code.

Not a hard requirement but at least show some effort you tried tinkering or fixing the issue by yourself, if you didn't I'd advise creating a discussion instead of an issue at first then we can talk and decide what's better for the situation.

Try to give as much information you can on what broke, try to filter non related things on the main issue.

If you're not comfortable uploading the .log file here on GitHub or creating an issue at all, you can DM me, see my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/Tremeschin) or the [Community, support, help](https://github.com/Tremeschin/modular-music-visualizer#community-support-help-donations) tab on the project main README
