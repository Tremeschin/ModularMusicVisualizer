# Thank You

Don't abuse from your freedom the power to ascend with this software with much hard work put on it.

Pay back your fees with a simple **"Thank you"** at least.

It doesn't seem much but pursuing something others also keep an expectancy or genuinely changed their lives for good is a hell of a great motivation: **being acknowledged not for feeling superior or meaningless better, but for being helpful, making a difference, gratitude.**

*Don't take this as an obligation, you're free, this software is free.*

The Modular Music Visualizer project definitely changed my life, I grew up so much as a programmer, my problem solving skills accuracy and speed improved a lot, not to mention general organization of stuff.. I'm already victorious on the existence and execution of such code.

Can't forget to **thank a lot all the people behind all the dependencies I used in this project**. We don't need to come up with pythagoras theorem from scratch anymore as someone did that for us in the past. Just like I don't need to make an complex video encoder, there's the FFmpeg team already. Old generations making a better world and time for future ones.

My sincere Thank You if you read the all the way until here, hopefully you learned something new and that this project helped you!!
